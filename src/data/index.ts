I'm a Software Engineer with nearly a decade of hands-on experience in web development, specializing in JavaScript technologies like React.js, Node.js, and Vue.js.

I thrive in team environments where collaboration and creativity are valued. Whether mentoring others or working alongside teammates, I enjoy sharing knowledge, tackling challenges, and continuously learning to improve my craft.
